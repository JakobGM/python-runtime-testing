The analysis of the data from the series of function calls suggest that the most effective method for representing integers is by use of the integer data type. This comes as no surprise. Tuple reassignment, which is a very "pythonic" approach, has also been shown to significantly decrease run time. The assumed dichotomy between readable code and efficient code is therefore a false one in this case. This is an endorsement of writing more "pythonic" code, when possible.
